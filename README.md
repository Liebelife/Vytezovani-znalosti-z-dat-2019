## 01 - web scraping, data visualisation

  - first experience working with dataframe and Markdown (the jupyter notebook could look better :)) I made progress in the following three homeworks.

## 03 - binary classsification using different models (Titanic dataset)
  - DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier

## 03 - clustering (custormer segmentation)
  - using K-means clustering, RFM model

## 04 - multivariate prediction using regression models
