Data Mining Homeworks

All the solutions are avaliable in solution.ipynb files in the 01, 02, 03, and 04 folders

## 01 - web scraping, data visualisation
  - using data from volby.cz
  - first experience working with dataframe and Markdown (the jupyter notebook could look better :)) I made progress in the following three homeworks.

## 03 - binary classsification using different models (Titanic dataset)
  - DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier

## 03 - clustering (custormer segmentation)
  - using K-means clustering, RFM model

## 04 - multivariate prediction using regression models
  - linear, ridge, lasso
